# Open Movement - Project Maturity

## Overview

The goal of this maturity description is to describe how the Open Movement project operates. 


## Code

*CD10* The project produces Open Source software, for distribution to the public at no charge.

*CD20* The project's code is easily discoverable and publicly accessible.

*CD30* The code can be built in a reproducible way using widely available tools. 

*CD40* The history of the project's code is available via a source code control system. 

*CD50* The provenance of each line of code is established via the source code control system. When third-party contributions are committed, commit messages provide information about the code provenance.


## Licenses and Copyright

*LC10* The code is released under an Open Source license. 

*LC20* The copyright ownership of everything that the project produces is clearly defined and documented.


## Releases

*RE10* Releases consist of source code.

*RE20* Convenience binaries can be distributed alongside source code.

*RE30* The release process is repeatable to the extent that someone could independently generate the complete set of artifacts required for a release. 


## Quality

*QU10* The project is open and honest about the quality of its code. Various levels of quality and maturity for various modules are natural and acceptable as long as they are clearly communicated. 

*QU20* The project aims to produce well documented software.

*QU30* The project members may be contact via a private channel to report security issues: (support `@` openmovement.dev)

*QU40* The project puts a priority on backwards compatibility and aims to document any incompatible changes and provide tools and documentation to help users transition to new features. 

*QU50* The project strives to respond to documented bug reports in a timely manner. 


## Community

*CO10* The project has a homepage that points to all the information required to operate. 

*CO20* The project welcomes contributions from anyone who acts in good faith and in a respectful manner and adds value to the project. 

*CO30* Contributions may include not only source code, but also documentation, constructive bug reports, constructive discussions, marketing and generally anything that adds value to the project. 

*CO40* The community is meritocratic and over time aims to give more rights and responsibilities to contributors who add value to the project. 

*CO50* The way in which contributors can be granted more rights such as commit access or decision power is clearly documented and is the same for all contributors. 

*CO60* The community operates based on consensus of its members (see CS10) who have decision power. Dictators, benevolent or not, are not welcome in Apache projects. 

*CO70* The project strives to answer user questions in a timely manner.
