As part of a national response to help the NHS during the Coronavirus pandemic. Open Lab, Newcastle University and Northumbria University partnered with AMAP, Sunderland University to design and develop a low cost, flatpack full face visor. The final output of this over the course of a 6 day design sprint was the Hannan Snap Visor.

## Summary

In honour of Katherine Hannan, a nurse went out of her way to be at the very front lines of caring for the sick during the Spanish Flu pandemic. The Hannan visor is a low cost full face visor designed for single sessional use.  Manufactured from Polypropylene and PVC, parts come  flat-packed, and can be sterilised then assembled in 1-2 minutes. The head strap is fully adjustable and allows the user the ability to wear full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during use.

The design originated from a laser cut version concept by [Smoke N Mirrors](https://community.andmirrors.co.uk/t/covid-19-laser-cut-face-shield/168) March 28, 2020.  After analysis and testing with healthcare workers the visor was completely redesigned to allow for the ability to manufacture via Die-cutting. This could allow the visor to be produced at scale and speed. 

The design has been through a series of iterations and testing with NHS healthcare workers at NHS trusts as well as with GP’s in the local area. Design modifications include new visor to cover face including the upper forehead preventing any aerosol or spatter to access from above. A redesigned adjustable "barbed" headband allowing the user to pull tightly with one hand, locking the visor in place.

## Manufacture

The following design has been intended for manufacture through die-cutting. The design can also however be made through laser-cutting. We have trialled several prototypes through this manner. 

**PLEASE NOTE** Do not laser process any PVC. This is dangerous and may damage your machinery through the release of Hydrogen Chloride. Please use alternative materials for the clear visor such as PET. 

The is made from one of two types of material:

* PVC - The clear visor area
* PP - The adjustable head strap and mount for the clear visor.

The visors can be shipped flatpacked and assembled via the end user using a series of "IKEA style" textless instructions for assembly as seen below. When distributing this design or visor, ensure that the end user has a copy of both the data sheet and the instructions.

## Usage

Recipients of the face shields are responsible for using their own judgement before deciding to order, receive, distribute and use these homemade face shields in any setting. Prior to use these visors should be sterilised. These face shields are single sessional use only. Discard after use. It is expected that these face shields will be used in conjunction with a face mask protecting the nose and mouth, in accordance with relevant guidelines. Face shields are not a replacement for or negate the need for users to continue to stringently follow the recommended hygiene practices or other relevant guidelines.
